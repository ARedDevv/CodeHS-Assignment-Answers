All assignments for different people are assigned differently this is my layout for each assignment for me.


## Unit 2

All of the Unit 2 Files but each class is different but this has all the "Programming With Karel" assignments.

## Unit 5

Finished (pain) some of the code is my and others are from reddit.

## Unit 6

Finished (also pain) one of the code is complete but the others are a joke. Add a pull request if your code fixes this problem.

## Hour of Python

Finished (easy as pie) The `Give_Some_Var.py` says that one of the var is broken. If your have a fix add a pull request that fixes this problem.
