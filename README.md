## FAQ

Q. Are you a furry?
A. Yes I have a very epic protogen OC but also ironically a cat in some places.

Q. Why does it say CUDA or Python?
A. Python is a unit so yeah. CUDA is for JavaScript unit but JS is incompatible with color data but CUDA is compatible with color data like `#FF1C55` or `rgb(255, 28, 85)` but some of it is in Binary since it uses 1's & 0's to render color aka Black and White.

Q. Why the frick do you format them for their coding language?
A. Cause it makes it cleaner to look through then `.txt` files and also gives a cool sidebar tag on github :D.
